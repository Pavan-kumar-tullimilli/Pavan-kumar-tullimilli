##  About Me  
From robotics computer vision to Agentic AI systems, I have spent a decade building intelligent systems across the full AI stack.


- **Generative AI (LLMs & RAG Systems)**
- **Agentic AI & Autonomous Systems**
- **2D Computer Vision**
- **3D Computer Vision & LiDAR**

My work spans building perception systems, large-scale multilingual LLM deployments, enterprise GenAI platforms, and autonomous multi-agent architectures.

I specialize in designing AI systems that can **perceive (vision), reason (LLMs), and act (agents)**.
